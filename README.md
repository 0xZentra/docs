# Welcome to Zentra

Zentra is the OS Layer of blockchain—a continuously evolving blockchain operating system layer. We are neither an L1 nor an L2; we run atop world computers and can swap to better ones like changing hardware. When faster, cheaper, or more decentralized world computers emerge, we can switch underneath the ecosystem with no user disruption and no need to rebuild.

Unlike traditional blockchain layers, Zentra's execution engine and ecosystem operate outside of blockchain nodes, leveraging Minus Theory to decouple consensus and execution. As an OS Layer we keep the ability to run in a decentralized way while partnering with more decentralized L1s over time. The iterating OS Layer makes the ecosystem portable to higher-TPS, lower-cost world computers and removes common constraints such as gas limits, enabling developers to ship richer applications with unprecedented ease.

## Roadmap

- **Testnets 1-3**: Completed for stability testing.
- **Mainnet Launch**: December 2025, with real funds and decentralized indexers.
- **TGE and Airdrop**: Pending; airdrop distributed after TGE.
- **Post-Launch**: Ecosystem growth, quantum upgrades as needed, continuous OS layer evolution.
