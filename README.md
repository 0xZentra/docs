# Welcome to Zentra

Zentra is an innovative base indexer and execution layer designed to work seamlessly with any blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain layers, Zentra operates outside of blockchain nodes, leveraging a novel concept design from Minus Theory. This approach removes limitations commonly associated with blockchain environments, such as gas constraints, enabling developers to build and deploy complex applications with unprecedented ease.
