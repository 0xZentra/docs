# Welcome to Zentra

Zentra is the first python ecosystem that guides the next generation in scaling blockchainâ€”breaking free from static designs.

Unlike traditional blockchain layers, Zentra's execution engine and ecosystem operate outside of blockchain nodes, leveraging a novel design from Minus Theory. This approach makes the ecosystem portable to future higher-TPS blockchains and removes limitations commonly associated with blockchain environments, such as gas constraints, enabling developers to build and deploy complex applications with unprecedented ease.
