# Airdrop Plan

Zentra is planning to launch an airdrop program before the mainnet goes live. Based on a completely new blockchain theory and framework, Zentra has chosen to be a "No VC" project, aiming to give users the first opportunity to participate in building the next generation of blockchain infrastructure.

Please note: The specific timing for Zentra's Token Generation Event (TGE) has not yet been determined, but it is anticipated in Q3/Q4 of 2026. The airdrop will be distributed after the TGE. We are committed to making all airdrop rules fully transparent and will execute them using mature, existing infrastructure and non-upgradable smart contracts to minimize human-related uncertainty.

## Airdrop Quantity

Zentra's total token supply is 21 million, identical to Bitcoin's. It is a utility token that represents the right to use the global state on the Zentra network. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens, which are consumed in transactions, the Zentra token does not deplete with use. This characteristic makes it more akin to a reusable resource, like land or precious metals.

This airdrop program will distribute approximately 2% of the total token supply. This percentage is intended to both incentivize early participants and prevent excessive selling pressure on the market from an overly large airdrop.

## Risk Disclaimer

It should be widely understood that any startup project comes with extremely high risks. We are deeply aware that financial stability is crucial for families and personal growth, which is why laws in many regions restrict high-risk investment opportunities, such as startups, to "accredited investors."

Even early participants in Bitcoin and Ethereum faced significant risks to their principal. Therefore, Zentra has designed a highly transparent participation mechanism. By using non-upgradable smart contracts, we provide a secure way for users to receive an airdrop. The inherent logic of the smart contract ensures that **users' principal is safe and cannot be misappropriated**, and users can withdraw their staked assets at any time.

## How to Participate

Users can participate in the Zentra airdrop in the following two ways:

1.  **Expand Influence**: Learn and spread core knowledge about Zentra to help the community grow, thereby earning influence-based airdrop rewards.
2.  **Stake Stablecoins**: Lock in your airdrop share by staking stablecoins. This is a method of participation with extremely low risk to your principal.
