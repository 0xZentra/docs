# Airdrop Plan

Zentra is planning to launch an airdrop program before the mainnet goes live and will open a second stage alongside mainnet launch. Based on a completely new blockchain theory and framework, Zentra has chosen to be a "No VC" project, aiming to give users the first opportunity to participate in building the next generation of blockchain infrastructure.

Please note: The specific timing for Zentra's Token Generation Event (TGE) has not yet been determined, but it is anticipated in Q3/Q4 of 2026. The airdrop will be distributed after the TGE. We are committed to making all airdrop rules fully transparent and will execute them using mature, existing infrastructure and non-upgradable smart contracts to minimize human-related uncertainty.

## Airdrop Quantity

Zentra's total token supply is 21 million, identical to Bitcoin's. It is a utility token that represents the right to use the global state on the Zentra network. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens, which are consumed in transactions, the Zentra token does not deplete with use. This characteristic makes it more akin to a reusable resource, like land or precious metals.

This airdrop program will distribute a fixed **0.5% (~105,000 tokens)** directly, plus a **5% option pool** reserved for participating accounts. Distribution is split into two stages:

* **Stage 1 (Influence Airdrop)**: Completed; rewarded early evangelists who spread Zentra’s vision.
* **Stage 2 (Funds×Time Airdrop + Options at mainnet)**: Fixed at **0.5% airdrop + 5% option pool**. Airdrop accrues linearly by “staked funds × time” until the 0.5% allocation is exhausted; end is recorded by on-chain contract events. Baseline: **every 1,000 USD stablecoin × 365 days = 1 Zentra token (delivered after TGE)**; each airdropped token also grants **10 option units from the 5% pool with a $100 strike**, exercisable later without prepaying and unaffected by principal withdrawal. Bridging assets to Zentra via the official bridge also earns airdrop tokens (from the same 0.5% pool) but does **not** grant options.

## Risk Disclaimer

It should be widely understood that any startup project comes with extremely high risks. We are deeply aware that financial stability is crucial for families and personal growth, which is why laws in many regions restrict high-risk investment opportunities, such as startups, to "accredited investors."

Even early participants in Bitcoin and Ethereum faced significant risks to their principal. Therefore, Zentra has designed a highly transparent participation mechanism. By using non-upgradable smart contracts, we provide a secure way for users to receive an airdrop. The inherent logic of the smart contract ensures that **users' principal is safe and cannot be misappropriated**, and users can withdraw their staked assets at any time.

Please also note:

* **Smart contract & DeFi infrastructure risk**: Contracts include emergency withdrawal from DeFi and will be fully open-sourced for community review; simple structure favors readability and safety.
* **Base chain / centralized L2 risk**: If the underlying L1 or a centralized L2 suffers a black-swan exploit or outage, the contracts cannot fully shield participants. Please evaluate cautiously.

## Why “Funds × Time + Options”?

Bitcoin’s early days were driven by a handful of people who could read and act on the whitepaper. Bitcoin later became Ethereum’s “launchpad,” with ICOs funding Ethereum’s start and DeFi emerging on Ethereum. We want a more readable, transparent, and fair rule so more people can join:

* **Equal cost, clear entry**: 1,000 USD × 365 days = 1 airdrop token + 10 option units at $100 strike; same terms for everyone, no backroom allocation.
* **Open yet Sybil-resistant**: Funds×time accrual plus auto-pause reduces the advantage of programmatic hoarding by “on-chain scientists.”
* **Long-tail incentive**: Options let participants reserve potential upside without upfront payment, inviting broader community builders beyond the tiny early expert set.

## Breaking the Traditional VC Model with DeFi

Startup investing is high-risk, and most retail participants can’t afford to lose principal even though primary-market upside (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) is attractive. DeFi opens a new path:

* **Use DeFi instead of VC for bootstrapping**: Zentra taps DeFi infra rather than traditional VC to obtain launch capital.
* **High potential upside, low principal risk**: Funds×time airdrop + options let participants retain withdrawal rights while keeping upside exposure.
* **Build real demand**: Our goal is to grow the Zentra ecosystem to drive real utility demand for the token.
* **Useful token as a product**: A useful token is an information good—no after-sales burden, no hardware lifecycle/failure, and potential appreciation.

## How to Participate

Users can participate in the Zentra airdrop in the following ways:

1.  **Expand Influence (Completed)**: Stage 1 influence airdrop is finished.
2.  **Stake Stablecoins (opens with mainnet)**: Total fixed at 0.5% airdrop + 5% option pool. Accrue by “funds × time,” flexible deposits/withdrawals. Baseline: 1,000 USD stablecoin × 365 days = 1 airdrop token (post-TGE) + 10 option units at $100 strike. End and pause are driven by on-chain events when the 0.5% pool is depleted. Principal remains withdrawable.
3.  **Official Bridge In (opens with mainnet)**: Bridge assets to Zentra via the official bridge to earn airdrop tokens from the 0.5% pool; this path does not include options. End is likewise determined by on-chain events.
