# Influence Airdrop (Stage 1, Completed)

Stage 1 Influence Airdrop has concluded; details remain here for reference.

Zentra's Influence Airdrop is designed to encourage community members to deeply understand Zentra's origins, goals, and vision.

## Why is Influence Important?

The development of blockchain is largely theory-driven. Since Satoshi's whitepaper, its core has been about creating unprecedented possibilities, not just meeting existing demands. However, many current blockchain projects are merely incremental innovations on Bitcoin or Ethereum, often sacrificing decentralization for performance.

Zentra, built on Minus Theory, positions itself as the blockchain OS Layer—neither L1 nor L2—and can evolve with new world computers instead of rebuilding new ecosystems each time. We can only stand out when more people understand this innovation and long-term vision, so we use the Influence Airdrop to encourage the community to spread Zentra’s ideas together.

## How to Participate?

We will guide you through Zentra's core knowledge with a series of carefully designed content and questionnaires. Participants will have the opportunity to explore:

* **Core Principles**: Zentra's operational mechanics, background story, and "Minus Theory."
* **Technical Philosophy**: Why we chose Python and how it brings greater security to the blockchain.
* **Design Philosophy**: Zentra's architectural trade-offs, its commitment to decentralization, and its future roadmap.

## Airdrop Rules and Algorithm

The core of the Influence Airdrop is "dissemination". We aim to reward members who help expand Zentra's community influence through engaging Q\&A interactions. The entire event can be participated in directly with your Twitter identity, requiring no complex onboarding tasks.

Your final airdrop amount will be primarily determined by your referral contributions and calculated using the following formula:

`Total Airdrop Share = (Base Airdrop Share + Referral Airdrop Share) × Knowledge Accuracy Multiplier`

**1. Base Airdrop Share**

* As long as you participate and complete the knowledge quiz with your Twitter identity (without answering all questions incorrectly or leaving them blank), you will receive a fixed base airdrop share as recognition for your contribution.

**2. Referral Airdrop Share**

* **Core Driver**: This is the **primary determinant** of your total airdrop share.
* **Calculation**: After participating, you will receive an exclusive referral link. Your referral airdrop share increases for each new member who participates and completes the knowledge quiz through your link. The more people you refer, the higher your share.

> **Tip:** After you complete the quiz, the URL of the current page will automatically become your exclusive referral link. Simply copy and share this link with your friends. When they participate through it, your referral airdrop share will increase.

**3. Knowledge Accuracy Multiplier**

* This is a **qualification threshold** and a **fine-tuning factor**.
* **Qualification Threshold**: You must participate in the knowledge quiz to be eligible for the airdrop. **If the quiz is left blank or all answers are incorrect, this multiplier will be 0, meaning you will not receive any airdrop.**
* **Fine-tuning Reward**: Your quiz accuracy will have a small positive impact on your final share. The higher your accuracy, the higher the multiplier, and your total share will receive a slight boost.

> **Disclaimer:** It's important to note that the specific algorithm for calculating influence requires consideration of numerous factors, which may appear opaque from a user's perspective. To support the development of decentralized projects, our goal is to distribute a small amount of utility tokens to as many real users as possible. Perfection is impossible, and we ask for your understanding of any imperfections we may encounter.
