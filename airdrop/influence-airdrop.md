# Influence Airdrop

Zentra's Influence Airdrop is designed to encourage community members to deeply understand Zentra's origins, goals, and vision.

## Why is Influence Important?

The development of blockchain is largely theory-driven. Since Satoshi's whitepaper, its core has been about creating unprecedented possibilities, not just meeting existing demands. However, many current blockchain projects are merely incremental innovations on Bitcoin or Ethereum, often sacrificing decentralization for performance.

Zentra, based on "Minus Theory" and a series of new concepts, breaks through the traditional definitions of L1/L2. We know that we can only stand out among the many infrastructure projects when more people understand Zentra's innovative philosophy and long-term vision. Therefore, we hope to use the Influence Airdrop to incentivize the community to spread Zentra's ideas with us.

## How to Participate?

We will guide you through Zentra's core knowledge with a series of carefully designed content and questionnaires. Participants will have the opportunity to explore:

*   **Core Principles**: Zentra's operational mechanics, background story, and "Minus Theory."
*   **Technical Philosophy**: Why we chose Python and how it brings greater security to the blockchain.
*   **Design Philosophy**: Zentra's architectural trade-offs, its commitment to decentralization, and its future roadmap.
