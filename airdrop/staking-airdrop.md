# Staking Airdrop

Zentra's Staking Airdrop is designed to distribute tokens to early supporters through a transparent and secure mechanism while ensuring the safety of user principal. We achieve this by leveraging mature blockchain infrastructure and non-upgradable smart contracts.

## Core Rule

The basic rule is very simple:

**For every 1,000 USD in stablecoins (USDC or USDT) staked for 365 days, you will receive 1 Zentra Token.**

This rule is flexible, with rewards proportional to "staked amount Ã— days staked." For example, staking 10,000 USD in stablecoins for a cumulative total of 36.5 days will also earn you 1 Zentra Token.

## Flexible Participation

*   **Multi-Chain Support**: Staking will be available on multiple Ethereum-compatible chains.
*   **Flexible Terms**: You can join or exit at any time, freely deciding your staking duration.
*   **Withdrawal Lock**: To maintain system stability and prevent frequent transactions, the smart contract requires a minimum lock-up period of **1 hour** after each deposit before a withdrawal can be made.

## Security and Transparency

This event is not yet open. Before the official launch, we will publish the smart contract code in advance for the community to conduct a full audit.
