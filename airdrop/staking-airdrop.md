# Staking Airdrop (Stage 2, opens with mainnet)

Zentra's Stage 2 airdrop starts with mainnet, using a “funds × time” model plus options, delivered via non-upgradable smart contracts to keep principal safe.

## Core Rules

* **Funds × time accrual**: Baseline rate is **every 1,000 USD stablecoin × 365 days = 1 Zentra token (delivered after TGE)** to keep participant cost equal. No preset cap.
* **Option bonus**: For each airdropped token you also get **10 option units** with a **$100 strike**, exercisable later at your discretion, no upfront payment required.
* **Dynamic depletion**: As total staking grows, tokens are consumed faster and the overall window shortens. The contract monitors remaining allocation and will pause new deposits before depletion.
* **After pause**: Only principal withdrawals are allowed; no new deposits.

## Flexible Participation

* **Flexible staking**: Deposit or withdraw anytime; no long lock-ups.
* **Multi-chain support**: Available on multiple Ethereum-compatible chains.

## Security and Transparency

* **Non-upgradable contracts**: Zentra cannot touch staked funds.
* **Open code**: Contracts will be published before launch for community audit.
* **Emergency withdraw logic**: Built-in path to pull funds from DeFi in emergencies; cannot eliminate systemic risk from a base chain or centralized L2 black swan.
