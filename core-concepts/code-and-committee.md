# Code and Committee

Blockchain technology has evolved significantly since Bitcoin introduced the first permissionless network. Bitcoin relies on BTC as a transaction fee, allowing anyone to participate in secure, decentralized transactions. Ethereum expanded this model by enabling users to pay gas fees not only for transactions but also to deploy smart contracts. This innovation allowed developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) with their own programmable rules, effectively granting users the ability to establish custom laws within these dApps.

However, this advancement also introduced challenges. The flexibility of Ethereumâ€™s smart contract created an "on-chain dark forest", where malicious smart contracts often go unnoticed until they harm end-users.
