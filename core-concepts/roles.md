# Roles

Zentra operates in close collaboration with blockchain nodes but remains distinct from being a blockchain itself. Its core functionality can be described by the following roles:

* **Interaction with Blockchain Nodes**: Users send transactions to blockchain nodes. The order and content of these messages are finalized through the consensus mechanism of the blockchain.
* **Deterministic State Calculation**: Zentra observes the frozen messages within a block, as determined by the blockchain consensus. It then calculates deterministic state results based on these messages.

This design ensures that Zentra remains a reliable and efficient execution layer, adhering to the immutable decisions made by the underlying blockchain while enabling advanced computations and state management.
