# Portable Ecosystem

Zentra is the frist portable ecosystem. Due to Minus Theory, it decouples the consensus and execution for the blockchain, it is possible to move ecosystem to another blockchain infrastucture now.

Modern blockchain can hardly balance from high transaction fees, limited programming flexibility, and decentrailzation. Zentra aim to solve those problem by making the ecosystem upgradable.

Meanwhile, due to the Minus Theory, Zentra can improve current blockchain system with the following aspects:&#x20;

* **Breaking Gas Limitations**: Developers can execute complex computations without worrying about gas constraints. The execution doesn't need to be finished before the next new blockc generated. Thus Minus Theory removes the execution time limitation.
* **Introducing Python to Blockchain**: Zentra makes Python the first programming language for blockchain applications, combining the simplicity and power of Python with the robust nature of decentralized systems.
* **Enhanced Audibility**: Pythonâ€™s readability and popularity in the developer community make blockchain programming more transparent and accessible. The more people can read, the more safety smart contract would get.

By combining these features, Zentra provides the way unlock new levels of scalability, and innovation. However, we still see the future of blockchains may provide better TPS, cheap gas fee, and towards the full decentrailzation. Zentra makes the ecosystem upgradable to move to future blockchains.
