# Quantum Resistance

Zentra’s upgradeable OS Layer and input-state separation give it a clear path to adapt when quantum threats emerge.

## Core Points

- **Upgradeable base**: Swap to a world computer or signature scheme that is quantum-safe when needed.
- **Input/state separation**: Signature verification is decoupled from global state, so replacing signatures does not touch user assets or app logic.
- **No performance drag**: Avoids the “large signatures, slow system” problem; throughput and UX stay intact after migration.

## Why Upgrades Stay Simple

- **Signature decoupling**: Signatures are not written into state; history is isolated from current state, easing algorithm replacement.
- **Ecosystem-stable**: Interfaces stay the same—users and developers don’t need to migrate or refactor.

## Typical Migration Steps

1) Continuously track quantum risks and standards  
2) Choose a quantum-safe algorithm / base chain  
3) Switch signatures and consensus at the OS Layer, migrate state and apps seamlessly  
4) Observe runtime data and iterate

## Long-Term Commitment

Minus Theory was not designed specifically for quantum resistance, but its input-state separation plus upgradeable architecture makes quantum-safe evolution low-friction, giving Web3 a path to long-term security. Note that quantum threats are not currently prioritized but can be addressed seamlessly when needed.
