# Upgradable Ecosystem

Zentra builds the OS Layer of blockchain—a continuously upgradable operating system layer that can move with the evolution of world computers. Minus Theory decouples consensus and execution, so we can migrate the ecosystem between blockchains like swapping hardware, without being a new L1 or L2.

Modern blockchains struggle to balance fees, flexibility, and decentralization. By hosting the ecosystem on an upgradable OS Layer, Zentra can swap the underlying world computer each year if needed, choosing faster or more decentralized bases while keeping Zentra itself decentralized.

Meanwhile, due to the Minus Theory, Zentra can improve current blockchain system with the following aspects:&#x20;

* **Always Update to latest TPS:** Blockchain tech evolves daily. Zentra chose the path of TPS upgradability: we can continuously move to the fastest world computer without disrupting apps or user assets, keeping the ecosystem sustainable.
* **Breaking Gas Limitations**: Developers can run heavy computation without gas anxiety. Execution need not finish before the next block, removing typical execution time limits.
* **Introducing Python to Blockchain**: Zentra makes Python the first-class language for blockchain apps, combining Python’s simplicity and power with decentralized robustness.
* **Enhanced Audibility**: Python’s readability and popularity make blockchain programming more transparent and accessible. More eyes on code means safer smart contracts.

By combining these features, Zentra unlocks new levels of scalability and innovation. As an OS Layer we can keep partnering with more decentralized L1s and operate on faster, cheaper world computers, while delivering seamless evolution for developers and users.

## Migration Between Different Architectures

Zentra currently runs on Ethereum-compatible chains, treating them as the "standard PCs" of the blockchain world. For non-EVM chains like Solana or Polkadot, migration involves rewriting code, similar to adapting DOS applications for Windows—while DOS apps can run on Windows, they often require rewriting for compatibility. Zentra's Python VM simplifies this process, as most applications can be rewritten more easily than in EVM languages, and the code's readability enhances security through broader audits.
