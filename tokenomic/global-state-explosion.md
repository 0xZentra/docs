# Global State Explosion

One of the significant challenges in blockchain systems, particularly Ethereum, is the problem of global state explosion. In Ethereum, the global state—which includes account balances, smart contract data, and other system information—grows uncontrollably as more applications and users interact with the network. This expansion leads to increased storage requirements, higher costs, and slower performance. Furthermore, there is currently no mechanism to shrink the global state effectively, making this issue persistent and critical.

Attempts to shard the global state—splitting it into smaller, manageable pieces—have also led to significant drawbacks. Sharding introduces complexities and results in lower performance when executing smart contracts, as cross-shard communication is both resource-intensive and slower.

Zentra addresses these issues by introducing a token-based mechanism to control state growth:

* **Tokenized State Control**: Zentra uses tokens as a means to regulate state allocation. Users must lock tokens to create or modify state, encouraging efficient use of resources and discouraging unnecessary state growth.
* **Incentivized State Management**: The staking mechanism aligns incentives by requiring users to optimize their state usage. If a state is no longer needed, users can reclaim staked tokens by deleting or archiving the corresponding state.
* **Lightweight State Tracking**: Zentra employs advanced indexing and storage techniques to keep the state lightweight and manageable without sacrificing performance or accessibility.

By implementing these measures, Zentra ensures that its execution layer and global state stay in control and efficient, even as the ecosystem grows. Developers can build applications with confidence, knowing that the underlying infrastructure is designed to handle state responsibly and sustainably. The system can remain decentralized because the hardware requirements are affordable to the majority.
