# Zentra Tokenomic

Zentra’s token economy combines **global state scarcity** with **tokenomics**, creating a revolutionary token paradigm—the first major innovation since Bitcoin. While some projects have attempted similar designs, they failed to recognize the true value of this new economic model.

Zentra’s core principles include:

1. **Driving Application Growth & Global State Demand** – By fostering more on-chain applications, Zentra ensures that blockchain global state is a valuable, controlled resource rather than an unbounded burden.
2. **Lowering Blockchain Application Barriers** – Zentra optimizes execution, allowing users to interact with blockchain technology at a significantly lower cost, increasing adoption.
3. **Encouraging Long-Term Token Holding** – Users who purchase Zentra tokens don’t just use them for transactions but can lock them to occupy global state resources, making token holding a long-term activity.

This model creates a sustainable ecosystem where:

* **Projects** benefit from increased global state value and growing token demand.
* **Investors** gain from long-term token appreciation and utility-driven demand.
* **Users** enjoy low-cost blockchain usage while benefiting from the increasing value of their holdings.

By moving beyond traditional blockchain tokenomics, Zentra transforms tokens from mere transactional fuel or speculative assets into essential drivers of **sustainable blockchain economic growth**.
