# Why Zentra?

Modern blockchain development often encounters challenges like high transaction fees, limited programming flexibility, and difficulty in auditing smart contracts. Zentra addresses these issues by:

* **Breaking Gas Limitations**: Developers can execute complex computations without worrying about gas constraints.
* **Introducing Python to Blockchain**: Zentra makes Python the first programming language for blockchain applications, combining the simplicity and power of Python with the robust nature of decentralized systems.
* **Enhanced Audibility**: Pythonâ€™s readability and popularity in the developer community make blockchain programming more transparent and accessible. The more people can read, the more safety smart contract would get.

By combining these features, Zentra redefines how developers interact with blockchains, providing tools to unlock new levels of efficiency, scalability, and innovation.

Meanwhile, as Zentra plays the duty of the heavy smart contract computation, the blockchain node could focus on the consensus on messages/transaction input. Zentra brings the new approach to increase blockchain TPS towards the massive adoption.&#x20;
