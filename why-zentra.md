# Why Zentra?

Future world computers will keep improving—more TPS, lower cost, stronger decentralization—but each leap usually forces everyone to rebuild a brand-new ecosystem, creating fragmentation and migration friction.

Zentra provides a “blockchain OS Layer”: an operating system layer that runs atop world computers, is upgradable at any time, and is neither a new L1 nor L2. It preserves the ability to run in a decentralized manner, and can switch to better world computers when they emerge—partnering with more decentralized L1s as the space evolves.

* **Ecosystem:** As an OS Layer, the ecosystem becomes independent; the blockchain/world computer underneath is what gets upgraded or swapped without rebuilding the ecosystem.
* **Outdated:** No more one-time, isolated picks. When base chains upgrade or better options appear, the OS Layer can move, avoiding dApps being stuck on stale chains.
* **Developers:** Focus on users and innovation instead of repeatedly bootstrapping ecosystems; upgrade the OS Layer beneath you as world computers improve.
* **Users:** No need to memorize new contract addresses or chase new ecosystems; OS Layer migrations are seamless to end users.
* **Investors:** Capital can stay with the evolving ecosystem instead of funding the same forked dApps on every chain, freeing resources for true innovation.
